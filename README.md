# JoystickSoftware

This is the Arduino software which runs on the microcontrollers found in the joysticks.

Very early devices (with the USB Micro connector) run the Arduino Pro Micro board. 

Everything since May 2022 has been running Adafruit QT PY SAMD21 boards. If you need the UF2, let me know.
