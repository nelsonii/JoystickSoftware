# JoystickSoftware

This is the Arduino software which runs on the microcontrollers found in the joysticks.

Very early devices (with the USB Micro connector) run the Arduino Pro Micro board. 

Everything since May 2022 has been running Adafruit QT PY SAMD21 boards. If you connect via a USB C cable, it's a QT PY. If you need any UF2 "disk images", let me know. I upload them as-needed by customers.
